# README Generator

## Project Description
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a README generator that could be generated through the command line in node. This project needed to take in user input and use it to generate said README. The sections that were needed to be generated were Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. This was done by creating a prompt through the inquirer npm and using it to plug information into a README template. For example when the user is asked to input a title that title is used for the README's title. Any information that the user inputs including the description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions then that information is also put into the README as well. The user also needed to be able to generate a license badge based on which license they choose and the license info is placed into the page as well. There is also a section that creates a link to the GitHub users profile with a section displaying the user's email. Along with this a working table of contents needs to be added as well. All of these things are created using template literals and a template for a README file.
